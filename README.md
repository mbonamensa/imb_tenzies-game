### The challenge

Tenzies is a 10-dice game and you win when you are able to roll your dice till all dice have the same number, in the shortest possible time.

Players should be able to:

- Roll the dice using a roll button

### What I learned

useEffect in React can be used to keep two states in sync. 


### Continued development

I am looking to add the following features to the game on my own to practice and gain more experience

- Time taken to win
- Number of rolls made to win
